* Hijri calendar
* Autoconfigure using GeoClue ? (Not introspectable ! Maybe use DBus)
* Add events (9th/10th Muharram, Dhul-Hijjah days, ...)
* Features from Bilal:
  + Takbeer in both Eids (@ startup only ?)
  + accurately setting the lunar calendar through the internet ?
  + مسحراتي
  + Manual setting of prayertimes ?
* Qiblah ?

Configuration:
* Option to use ~/.iprayrc or local config
* Option to import Minbar settings
* Basic tab (disabled if not using local config)
  + Location & method config
* Advanced tab (disabled if using ~/.iprayrc)
* Country database (from monajat-data's cities.db)

Power saving logic:
* Only compute prayer times once:
  + After today's Isha time: NextDayFajr
  + At new day: all prayertimes
* @every minute: just check remaining minutes
* redo all above at clock change or resume
